# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

For this challenge, we were provided with some starter code for the index.html file, as well as the data set in samples.json. Our initial app.js file was blank, our instructor provided a starter with minimal beginnings of the coding needed to complete the assignment.

From there the challenge was to create an interactive dashboard to review data on Bellt Button Biodiversity that would allow for the metadata of individual test subjucts to be called on request and displayed in a bar, gauge and bubble chart. After building the dashboard I then needed to set up a host for the page, I chose to use GitPages (https://joelcwiseman.github.io/belly-button-challenge/)

For the challenge I relied on examples from class, including the starter provided by our instructor. I also used my copy of the book JavaScript from Beginner to Professional
By Laurence Lars Svekis, Maaike van Putten, Codestars By Rob Percival for further understanding of the subject in order to complete the challenge. Finally, I enlisted the assistance of the CodePal Code Reviewer (https://codepal.ai/code-reviewer) for assistance in troubleshooting issues that arose.
